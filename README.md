A stack of n disks of decreasing size is placed on one of three posts. The task is to move the
disks one at a time from the first post to the second. To do this, any disk can be moved
from any post to any other post, subject to the rule that you can never place a larger disk
over a smaller disk. The (spare) third post is provided to make the solution possible. Our goal is to
write a recursive function that describes instructions for a solution to this problem. We will output
a sequence of instructions that will solve the problem.
